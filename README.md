# ReJSON - a JSON data type for Redis

ReJSON is a [Redis](http://redis.io/) module that implements [ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Standard](http://json.org/) as a native data type. It allows storing, updating and fetching JSON values from Redis keys (documents).

Primary features:

* Full support of the JSON standard
* [JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)-like syntax for selecting element inside documents
* Documents are stored as binary data in a tree structure, allowing fast access to sub-elements
* Typed atomic operations for all JSON values types

## Quickstart

1.  [Launch ReJSON with Docker](https://redislabsmodules.github.io/rejson/#launch-rejson-with-docker)
1.  [Use ReJSON from **any** Redis client](https://redislabsmodules.github.io/rejson/#using-rejson), e.g.:

![ReJSON with `redis-cli`](docs/images/demo.gif)

## Documentation

Read the docs at https://redislabsmodules.github.io/rejson

## Current limitations and known issues

* Searching for object keys is O(N)
* Containers are not scaled down after deleting items (i.e. free memory isn't reclaimed)
* Numbers are stored using 64-bit integers or doubles, and out of range values are not accepted

## Acknowledgements

ReJSON is developed with <3 at [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com).

ReJSON is made possible only because of the existance of these amazing open source projects:

* [jsonsl](https://github.com/mnunberg/jsonsl)
* [redis](https://github.com/antirez/redis)
